This is a foray into developing my knowledge and understanding of buildingand implementing a Representational State Transfer (RESTful) application program interface (API).

The primary HTTP methods this API will handle are:
   - POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
   
These HTTP methods will only be accessible via specified routes, given the URL path provided by the user.
